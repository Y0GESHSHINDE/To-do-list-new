## To-Do List Web Application

### Project Description
This is a simple, responsive **To-Do List** web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks to a list, remove them once completed, and manage their daily tasks easily. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

### Features
- Add tasks to the list.
- Clear tasks after they are added.
- Simple, intuitive user interface.
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop views.
- Basic form validation (e.g., ensures that tasks aren't added if the input is empty).

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout (with responsive design considerations).
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation and event handling.

### How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd to-do-list
   ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**.

### How It Works

1. Users enter their task in the input field and click the **"Add task"** button.
2. The task is dynamically added to the task list below.
3. The input field is cleared after each task is added.
4. Tasks can be easily managed (additional features like deleting tasks can be implemented in the future).

### Future Enhancements
- Add functionality to mark tasks as complete by clicking on them.
- Add a delete button to remove tasks.
- Add persistence using **localStorage** so tasks remain after a page refresh.
- Enhance the UI with better animations and design.
